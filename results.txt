Results:
I found that it takes just more than 1000 generations at 300
starting population to evolve "SKYNET IS NOW ONLINE" from random
starting strings. Changing the mutation probability drastically decreases
how long it takes to reach its final form, but creates a lot of problems
in the species when it does. More members of the population end up being
mutated. I also tried changing the probability of mating, and the higher it is
the quicker the population converges. I am still left with questions though.
When would you not want the highest possible mating probability?
What is the optimal mutation probability?
How do you apply evolutionary-algorithms to things that aren't strings?

Overall, this is really cool. Both this toolbox, and my mini-project on the markov
method of text generation got me very interested in generating things with computers
I am proud of the work I did on both
